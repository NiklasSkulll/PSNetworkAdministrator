# Invoke-PSNetworkAdmin.ps1
# Main entry point script for PSNetworkAdministrator

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Provides a text-based menu interface for Windows network administration.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the main entry point for the PSNetworkAdministrator module.
    It presents a unified menu-driven interface that allows administrators to
    perform common network administration tasks without using GUI tools.
    
    The menu includes options for user management, computer management,
    group management, network diagnostics, DNS management, DHCP information,
    domain controller info, security auditing, system health checks, and domain switching.

.PARAMETER Domain
    Specifies the Active Directory domain to connect to.
    If not specified, the current domain will be used.

.PARAMETER Credential
    PSCredential object for domain access.
    If not specified, the current user's credentials will be used.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Path where log files should be stored.
    Defaults to the Logs directory in the module path.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-PSNetworkAdmin
    # Starts the menu interface using the current domain and credentials

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-PSNetworkAdmin -Domain "contoso.com" -Credential $adminCred
    # Connects to the specified domain with the provided credentials

.NOTES
    Requires the Active Directory module and elevated privileges for most operations.
    Tested on PowerShell 5.1 and 7.2.
    For full functionality, run on a domain-joined machine with RSAT tools installed.
